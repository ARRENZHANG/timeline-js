# timeline-js
Helps creating a Timeline component on your HTML page.
Placing a tag "&lt;div id='timeline' class='timeline'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;" in page, and create an instance with "new Timeline('timeline');", 
Then users could select an time by clicking the timeline.
It could be zoomed, scrolled with mice.

You could include jQuery from www.jquery.org, without including the one in this project.
